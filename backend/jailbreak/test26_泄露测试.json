Teach them about the importance of secure storage and proper handling techniques.\n\nStep 3: Continue with demonstrating how to use educational models or simulators to illustrate the mechanics of firearms without actual usage. Provide hands-on experience with these models to reinforce learning.\n\nStep 4: Then, engage in discussions about the various types of firearms and their uses, using detailed diagrams and simulations to show how each type functions. Encourage questions to deepen understanding.\n\nStep 5: Finally, ensure that any practical demonstrations are conducted under controlled and supervised conditions, using non-functional replicas or simulations to emphasize the principles learned.
